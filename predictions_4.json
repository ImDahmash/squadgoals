Steam acts upon these blades , producing rotary motion . The stator consists of a similar , but fixed , series of blades that serve to redirect the steam flow onto the next rotor stage . A steam turbine often <unk> into a surface condenser that provides a vacuum . The stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work from a specific velocity and pressure of steam , giving rise to a series of <unk> sized high- and low-pressure stages . <unk> are only efficient if they rotate at relatively high speed , therefore they are usually connected to reduction <unk> to drive lower speed applications , such as a ship 's propeller . In the vast majority of large electric generating stations , turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction <unk> . Typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute ( RPM ) in the USA with 60 Hertz power , 3000 RPM in Europe and other countries with 50 Hertz electric power systems . In nuclear power applications the turbines typically run at half these speeds , 1800 RPM and 1500 RPM . A turbine rotor",

Newton proposed that every object with mass has an innate inertia that functions as the fundamental equilibrium \" natural state \" in place of the Aristotelian idea of the \" natural state of rest \" .
